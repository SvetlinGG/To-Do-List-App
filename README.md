As a company manager, you're constantly juggling decisions, deadlines, and team dynamics. In such a fast-paced environment, keeping a notebook isn't just a habit — it's a strategic tool. A well-maintained record of notes helps track project progress, capture key ideas from meetings, and improve communication across the team. I built NoteSpace to offer a lightweight, accessible way to manage notes while integrating role-based access control through Permit.io. Every note becomes more than just a thought — it's a record of context, responsibility, and collaboration.
